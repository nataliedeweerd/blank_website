# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Indentation should be 4 spaces (not a tab).
- If adding an undocument bug, ensure it's added to bugs.txt and bugs.docx (along with a screenshot of the bug in the .docx file).
- When creating a bug, check it does not interfere with any other bugs, and ensure you document it in bugs.txt and bugs.docx (along with a screenshot of the bug in the .docx file).
